# doom config

My configuration consists of a single `config.org`, which needs to be placed in `~/.config/doom`:

* [config.org](config.org) - also viewable as [HTML](https://jsravn.github.io/emacs-config/config.html).

Doom will auto-generate the required files from `config.org` when running `doom sync`.
